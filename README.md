### Project
Our project is a disscussion forum website. Registered users will be able to participate in discussions and unregisterd users will be able to view discussions.
#### Requirements
- Hand-styled layout with contextual menus (i.e. when user has logged on to site, menus reflect change).

- 2 or 3 column layout using appropriate design principles (i.e. highlighting nav links when hovered over, etc) responsive design

- Form validation with JavaScript

- Server-side scripting with PHP

- Data storage in MySQL

- Appropriate security for data

- Site must maintain state (user state being logged on, etc)

- Responsive design philosophy (minimum requirements for different non-mobile display sizes)

- AJAX (or similar) utilization for asynchronous updates (meaning that if a discussion thread is updated, another user who is viewing the same thread will not have to refresh the page to see the update)

- User images (thumbnail) and profile stored in database

- Simple discussion (topics) grouping and display

- Navigation breadcrumb strategy (i.e. user can determine where 
they are in threads)

- Error handling (bad navigation)

- Search and analysis for topics/items

- Hot threads/hot item tracking

- Visual display of updates, etc (site usage charts, etc)

- Activity by date

- Tracking (including utilizing tracking API or your own with - - visualization tools)

- Collapsible items/treads without page reloading

- Alerts on page changes

- Admin view reports on usage (with filtering)

- Tracking comment history from a userâ€™s perspective
